Download `scrambler.py` and run `python scrambler.py`.

Follow prompt (make sure you have the right path to your image) and voila!

Similar instructions for `shift_cipher.py`, though now you have an extra prompt! Make sure you only enter three numbers in the range 0-255, separated by spaces.

Also, make sure image is in the same directory. No guarantees it will work otherwise. Look into PIL library to see how paths are handled.
